# Bias Finder

Bias Finder is currently avaliable on Firefox and Chome, due both to their large userbase and ease of extension development. Safari and Edge are not supported because Microsoft and Apple act like they want to make it hard for third-party developers.

This add-on can be found packaged and signed [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bias-finder/).
