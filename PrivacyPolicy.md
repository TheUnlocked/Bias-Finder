### On information gathered from Google Analytics usage
* No personally identifying information will be recorded or released.
* Anonymous user identification will be gathered, but it will not be released.
  * This information will be used only if it is believed that a user is attempting to tamper with Analytics data.
  * This information will not be used to limit usage of Bias Finder, but it may induce a ghost ban on Google analytics tracking.
    * This ghost ban will not affect end-user usage of Bias Finder in any way.
* Google Analytics data gathered will not be sold, exchanged, or given to any third party without public release.
  * An exception is if the data is given to a third party in preparation for public release.
    * All data given this way will be under embargo until public release.
    
**tl;dr** Sending usage data to Google Analytics will not affect you, but you may opt out anyways if you wish.
