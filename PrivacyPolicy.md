## On information gathered from Google Analytics usage
* No personally identifying information will be recorded or released.
* Anonymous user identification will be gathered, but it will not be released.
  * This information will be used only if it is believed that a user is attempting to tamper with Analytics data.
  * This information will not be used to limit usage of Bias Finder, but it may induce a ghost ban on Google analytics tracking.
    * This ghost ban will not affect end-user usage of Bias Finder in any way.
* Google Analytics data gathered will not be sold, exchanged, or given to any third party without public release.
  * An exception is if the data is given to a third party in preparation for public release.
    * All data given this way will be under embargo until public release.
    
**tl;dr** Sending usage data to Google Analytics will not affect you, but you may opt out anyways if you wish. Your data won't be sold if you stay opted in.

### Bias Finder will track the following data
* Sites that users visit which are listed on allsides.
  * As well as the associated bias of those sites
* The site a user is on when the popup is clicked, if that site has a listing
  * If the site does not have a listing, data is also sent but that data will not list any information about the site visited.
* When a user clicks a footer link, or the "Click here for more information" link on listed sites
* The value of search terms when a user uses the _search allsides for this news site_ search box.
* When a user updates to a new version of Bias Finder, and what that new version is.
